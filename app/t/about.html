            <p class="animated fadeIn delay-1s slow">Born and raised on the central coast of California, Cassidy lives with her husband, two sons, and a scrappy dog named Kira, in Bloomington, Indiana. She has had the pleasure of living in Hilo, Hawaii and Okinawa, Japan. She satisfies her wanderlust with actively exploring the woods, restaurants, and hidden gems of Bloomington and Southern Indiana in between her rare adventures to far flung international destinations.</p>
            <p class="animated fadeIn delay-1s slow">In 2014 she completed a Masters Degree in Art Education from Indiana University, Bloomington and in 2004 a Bachelors of Studio Art from the University of California, Santa Barbara. She is a high school art teacher at the Academy of Science and Entrepreneurship in Bloomington Indiana where she teaches a variety of creative subjects and dual credit courses with Ivy Tech.</p>
            <p class="animated fadeIn delay-1s slow">If she's not working at school or in her own art studio you might find her scuba diving, gardening, or just reading in the backyard hammock. Cassidy is a member of the Art Educators Association of Indiana (AEAI), the National Art Educators Association (NAEA), and the Bloomington Watercolor Society (BWS).</p>
            <p class="animated fadeIn delay-1s slow">Cassidy is a lifelong learner and has been an artist since she was very small. Among her notable awards and achievements she received the Indiana Arts Commission (IAC) Grant in 2018, best in show at the Art of Chocolate in 2016 & 2013.</p>
